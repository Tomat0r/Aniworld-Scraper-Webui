If you want to use ublock to make downloads more consistent and not randomly fail
download ublock from GitHub and put the content in a folder here called "ublock".
It should look like this: src/extensions/ublock/_locals......

Ublock: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
DO NOT USE UBLOCK LITE!
The reason is that Ublock Lite always opens a config pop up that cant be removed...
